class MyLSTMCell(RNNCell):
    """
    Your own basic LSTMCell implementation that is compatible with TensorFlow. To solve the compatibility issue, this
    class inherits TensorFlow RNNCell class.

    For reference, you can look at the TensorFlow LSTMCell source code. To locate the TensorFlow installation path, do
    the following:

    1. In Python, type 'import tensorflow as tf', then 'print(tf.__file__)'

    2. According to the output, find tensorflow_install_path/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py

    So this is basically rewriting the TensorFlow LSTMCell, but with your own language.

    Also, you will find Colah's blog about LSTM to be very useful:

        Initialize a class instance.

        In this function, you need to do the following:

        1. Store the input parameters and calculate other ones that you think necessary.

        2. Initialize some trainable variables which will be used during the calculation.

        :param num_units: The number of units in the LSTM cell.
        :param num_proj: The output dimensionality. For example, if you expect your output of the cell at each time step
                         to be a 10-element vector, then num_proj = 10.
        :param forget_bias: The bias term used in the forget gate. By default we set it to 1.0.
        :param activation: The activation used in the inner states. By default we use tanh.

        There are biases used in other gates, but since TensorFlow doesn't have them, we don't implement them either.

        You will notice that TensorFlow LSTMCell has a lot of other features. But we will not try them. Focus on the
        very basic LSTM functionality.

        Hint 1: If you try to figure out the tensor shapes, use print(a.get_shape()) to see the shape.

        Hint 2: In LSTM there exist both matrix multiplication and element-wise multiplication. Try not to mix them.

        :param inputs: The input at the current time step. The last dimension of it should be 1.
